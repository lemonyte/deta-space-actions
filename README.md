# Deta Space Actions

Python package to interact with Deta Space Actions.

Ported from the Node package [deta-space-actions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deta-space-actions).

This package is somewhat temporary, hopefully its functionality will be implemented in a future version of the official [Deta Python SDK](https://github.com/deta/deta-python).

## TODO

- [ ] Finish writing it
  - [ ] Generic ASGI middleware
  - [ ] Invocation function
- [ ] Make it installable
- [ ] Write a README
